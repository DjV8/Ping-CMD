# Ping-CMD
It's a small window that shows your ping / package losses

It's heavily based on a Redditors work: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/85fid3/i_made_a_batch_script_to_check_your_ping_out_of/

So basically if you want to change the destination address, I have a marked spot to do so, also there's an option to change the window size (also marked). 

# BIG NOTE!!!
If it's not working then close it or it will over-fill your RAM!
Tbh I don't know how to fix it :/
